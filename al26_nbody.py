  Evolve simulation with an adaptive timestep

  Timestep calculation:
  - Timestep is separate from N-body step, which is handled by the numerical solver
  - Timestep is adaptive, and evolves from two main conditions
    - Proximity and sudden intercept velocity with massive stars, timestep is determined by
      the determining the first low-mass star to collide with a massive star assuming it was
      travelling on a collision course at its current velocity, this is then divided by 10
      for good measure. This is a fairly fast calculation but can change timestep effectively
      for close encounters
    - If timestep exceeds expected next plot interval, use that instead
  
  Simulation synchronisation:
  - Synchronisation is manual, as there were some issues in getting this to work properly
  - Instead, synchronisation only occurs when it is explicitly needed:
    - Mass
    - Position
    - Supernova kick velocity

  Routines, in order of execution:
  - Determine timestep
  - Check if plotting should occur/simulation should finish
  - Evolve N-body
    - Update positions of stars over tiemstep
    - Resolve supernova kick from previous step
  - Evolve stars
    - Adjust masses, synchronise with N-body for next step
    - Check to see if star has gone supernova, sychronize kick with N-body
  - Evolve discs
    - Check for wind/supernovae injection
    - Calculate mixing fractions, add mass
  - Write data
    - Write CSV files, 1 column for each star
      - Al26 Wind gain rate
      - Total Al26 mass
      - Total Fe60 mass
      - Al26/Al27 mixing ratio
      - Fe60/Fe56 mixing ratio
    - Plot stellar positions
      - High mass and low mass stars are divided into populations
      - 1000 plots per simulation, even timestepping

  Inputs:
  - cluster: contains parameters of each star, handles:
    - Disc parameters, radius, lifetime, whether they are extant
    - Storage of mass injection
    - Supernova kick confirmation
  - stellar: SeBa stellar evolution simulation, which handles:
    - Stellar evolution, of course!
    - Evolutionary phase (MS, PMS, SNRelic, etc.)
    - Mass loss rate
  - gravity: N-body solver, handles:
    - Kinematics
    - Also stores the current canonical time
  - t_f: Final time to evolve to (AMUSE units, Myr)
  - bar: TQDM progress bar
  Outputs:
  - All outputs and inputs are mirrored
  - Initially this was just going to recurse, but Python stack depth limitations are strict
